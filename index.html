    <h1>The Story of Amayara and Kiara</h1>

    <div class="story">
        <p>Once upon a time, in the magical valley of Lunaria, lived two sisters — Amayara and Kiara.</p>

        <p>Amayara was calm and wise. She understood the whispers of the wind and the songs of the birds.</p>

        <p>Kiara was adventurous and full of spark. Her laughter could make flowers bloom.</p>

        <p>One night, a violet light appeared in the sky. The next morning, they discovered a glowing crystal.</p>

        <p>Together, they climbed the tallest mountain and unlocked an ancient gateway of stars.</p>

        <p>From that day on, Amayara and Kiara became the protectors of Lunaria — guiding others with wisdom and courage.</p>
